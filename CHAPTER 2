Setting Up a Development Server
If you wish to develop Internet applications but don't have your own development server, you will have to upload every modification you make to a somewhere else on the Web before you can test it.

Even on a fast broadband connection, this can still represent a significant significant slowdown in development time.
On a local computer, however, testing can be as easy as saving an update (usually just a master of clicking once on an icon) and the hitting the Refresh button in your brower.

Another advantage of a development server is that you don't have to worry about embarrassing errors or security problems while you're writing and testing, whereas you need to be aware of what people may see or do with your application when it's on a pubic website.
It's easy to set one up.
Just follow the steps in the following sections, using the appropriate instructions for a PC, a MAC, or a Linux system.
